The following is a configuration example with details about each property. The
file is written using HOCON format, similarly to the application configuration
file.

```
// Device type name
name: Chiller

// The protocol used by this device, allowed values are AMQP, MQTT, HTTP
protocol: AMQP

// The telemetry sent by the Chiller
telemetry {

    // Min: 1 second
    // Units: ms, milliseconds, s, second, seconds, m, minute, minutes, h, hour, hours, d, day, days
    // Examples: "1500ms", "1s", "1 second", "5 seconds", "2minutes", "1 h" etc. (optional whitespace is ignored)
    frequency: 5 seconds

    // The simulation will send a JSON string with 4 fields.
    // Temperature and humidity values are generated by javascript functions stored in external files.
    // The output of the javascript function is injected as is, so you could for example generate the entire JSON, see below
    message-content: '{
        "temperature" : $(javascript:random-temperature-celsius.js),
        "humidity": : $(javascript:random-percentage.js),
        "t_unit" : "C",
        "h_unit" : "%"
    }'

    // Example: how to generate the entire message from a Javascript function:
    //message-content: '$(chiller-function.js)'

    // The list of all the fields contained in the message template
    // For each field indicate the type, allowed values are "number", "text" and "boolean"
    // The schema, if present, is published to the device twin, so that backend applications can interpret the telemetry messages.
    // If the schema is missing or empty, backend application will need to know how to extract data.
    message-schema {

        // Any string understood by the backend, typically an identifier and a version number
        // The value specified here is sent in a message header
        name:  chiller;v1

        // Any string understood by the backend, typically an identifier and a version number
        // The value specified here is sent in a message header
        format: JSON

        fields: {
            // The temperature field contains a random numnber generated by the function in random-temperature-celsius.js
            temperature: number

            // The humidity field contains a random numnber generated by the function in random-percentage.js
            humidity: number

            // The temperature unit is a string always set to "C" for Celsius
            t_unit: text

            // The humidity unit is a string set to "%"
            h_unit: text
        }
    }
}

// The asynchronous commands supported by the device, other command are rejected
// For each command the simulation can accept, abandon or reject
// The simulation engine will publish the list in the twin, so that a backend application can discover it.
supported-commands {

    reboot {
        // Allowed values: complete, abandon, reject
        response: accept
    }

    reset {
        // Allowed values: complete, abandon, reject
        response: complete
    }
}

// The synchronous methods supported by the device, other methods are ignored
// For each method the simulation can respond with some data
// The simulation engine will publish the list in the twin, so that a backend application can discover it.
supported-methods {

    reboot {
        response: "OK"
    }

    reset {
        response: "FAIL"
    }
}
```

# Device type name

This value is used to identify the device type. We recommend to use the same
value in the file name.

```
name: <string>
```

# Protocol

IoT devices can connect using different protocols. The simulation allows to
use AMQP, MQTT, HTTP.

```
protocol: <string>
```
