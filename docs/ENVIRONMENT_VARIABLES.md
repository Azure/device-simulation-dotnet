# Environment Variables

The service requires some mandatory environment settings and supports some
customizations via optional environment variables.

Depending on the OS and how the microservice is run, environment variables
can be defined in multiple ways. See below how to set environment variables
in the different contexts.

## Mandatory settings

* `PCS_IOTHUB_CONNSTRING` [required]: contains the full connection string
  required to connect devices and send telemetry. The value, even if empty,
  is required.
* `PCS_STORAGEADAPTER_WEBSERVICE_URL` [required]: the URL where the storage
  adapter service is available, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:9022/v1`.
* `PCS_STORAGEADAPTER_DOCUMENTDB_CONNSTRING` [required]: contains the full 
  connection string required to connect to an Azure CosmosDB SQL instance.
* `PCS_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` [required]: contains the full connection string
  required to connect to an Azure Storage Account instance.

## Optional settings

* `PCS_LOG_LEVEL` [optional, default `Warn`]: the amount and level of logging.
  Supported values are `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`.
* `PCS_TWIN_READ_WRITE_ENABLED` [optional, default `True`]: whether the service
  reads and write the Device Twin.  Currently not used.
* `PCS_AUTH_REQUIRED` [optional, default `True`]: whether the web service
  requires client authentication, e.g. via the Authorization headers.
* `PCS_CORS_WHITELIST` [optional, default empty]: the web service cross-origin
  request settings. By default, cross origin requests are not allowed.
  Use `{ 'origins': ['*'], 'methods': ['*'], 'headers': ['*'] }` to allow
  any request during development.  In Production CORS is not required, and
  should be used very carefully if enabled.
* `PCS_AUTH_ISSUER` [optional, default empty]: the OAuth2 JWT tokens
  issuer, e.g. `https://sts.windows.net/fa01ade2-2365-4dd1-a084-a6ef027090fc/`.
* `PCS_AUTH_AUDIENCE` [optional, default empty]: the OAuth2 JWT tokens
  audience, e.g. `2814e709-6a0e-4861-9594-d3b6e2b81331`.
* `PCS_SUBSCRIPTION_DOMAIN` [optional, default empty]: Azure Active
  Directory Domain of the Azure subscription where the Azure IoT Hub is
  deployed. The value is optional because the service can be deployed without
  a hub. The value is used to create a URL taking to the IoT Hub metrics in
  the Azure portal.
* `PCS_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` [optional, default empty]: # Azure subscription
  where the Azure IoT Hub is deployed, e.g. "mytest.onmicrosoft.com". The
  value is optional because the service can be deployed without a hub.
  The info is used to create a URL taking to the IoT Hub metrics in the
  Azure portal.
* `PCS_RESOURCE_GROUP` [optional, default empty]: # Azure resource group
  where the Azure IoT Hub is deployed, e.g. "abcd1234-5678-1234-abcd-abcd5678abcd".
  The value is optional because the service can be deployed without a hub.
  The info is used to create a URL taking to the IoT Hub metrics in the
  Azure portal.
* `PCS_IOHUB_NAME` [optional, default empty]: # IoT Hub name, e.g. "mytest3507e89".
  The value is optional because the service can be deployed without a hub.
  The info is used to create a URL taking to the IoT Hub metrics in the
  Azure portal.

# How to define Environment Variables

### Environment variables in Windows

Environment variables can be set globally via the Control Panel. From the
Start menu search "environment variables" and open the first result
("Edit the system environment variables"). In the Advanced tab, click the
"Environment Variables" button to open the window where you can add/edit
variables. 

NOTE: After changing environment variables, be sure to restart the 
process that is launching the device simulation process. For example, if 
you're running device simulation from Visual Studio, restart Visual Studio
after making any modifications to environment variables. 

### Environment variables in Linux and MacOS

In Unix-like systems environment variables are usually inherited from the
parent process. To set variables *globally* (i.e. for all processes) you
can use Bash settings (e.g. customize `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file).
In MacOS you can also use `launchctl setenv`.

### Environment variables when using Visual Studio

Global variables still apply, however it's possible to store environment
variables in the the startup project settings.

Right click on the WebService project, select Properties. Environment
variables can be set in `Debug` section.

These can be found also in the `WebService/Properties/launchSettings.json` file.

### Environment variables when using IntelliJ Rider

If you are using IntelliJ Rider or other IDEs, environment variables
are usually defined in the *run* configurations, and can be optionally
be inherited (or not) from the system.

Some IDEs store these in the `WebService.csproj` file.

### Environment variable when using Docker command line

Global variables values can be referenced, specifying only the name,
or passed explicitly inline.

Example 1, use global values:

```
docker run -e PCS_IOTHUB_CONNSTRING -e PCS_STORAGEADAPTER_WEBSERVICE_URL azureiotpcs/device-simulation-dotnet
```

Example 2, pass values explicitly:

```
docker run -e PCS_IOTHUB_CONNSTRING="...value here..." -e PCS_STORAGEADAPTER_WEBSERVICE_URL="...value here..." azureiotpcs/device-simulation-dotnet
```

### Environment variable when using Docker Compose

Global variables values can be referenced, specifying only the name,
or set explicitly, inlining the values in the configuration file,
typically `docker-compose.yml`.
